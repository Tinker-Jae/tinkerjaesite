holy shit is this a doozy
so this redo of the website, has a lot of features

- format is less confusing and much more readable
- works on many different screens, up to abt 2400

overall it's great and super readable and fun! 
the main downsides are

	- like I don't think u understand, I can barely do abt me, I can't do blinkies. 
- anything suited better for wide format is kinda impossible now.
- can't do radio
- shit man.
still not bad if I work some kinks out.

!- FIX (visuals) template for posts, make it more readable, and consistent
!- FIX (functionality) post template, figure out how to make it easier to use and easier to view.
	like a well formatted word doc.
