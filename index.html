		<h1><u>Welcome!</u></h1>
		<p>
			Hello and welcome to Tinker Jae!<br> 
			This is my blog/website where I post stuff about my life, stuff I like, and stuff I'm working on or have worked on.
			I've made this site to try and get away from modern social media and to have my own place on the internet. If you want to know more, check out my manifesto.
			If you're trying to find something specific, you'd be best checking out the sitemap below.
			I hope you enjoy the site, and thank you for stopping by!

				Hi! I'm Jae and I am the Webmaster for this blog. I'm a college student studying engineering who's really into art, tech, 
				guns, cartoons, working out, music, and a bunch of other stuff.
				I'm a big fan of Adventure Time and She-Ra, and am into bands like KGLW.
				I hope not to be too political on here, but I'm Pro-2A, Pro-Choice, and Pro-LGBTQ, if you're not really into
				all of that then viewer discretion is advised.
				My Pronouns are He/They/It.
