		<p>Hi welcome to my website!</p>
		<p>I'm Jae and I run this blog, I like tinkering with stuff so there you go. 
			The layout is still a bit of a work in progress but it's been going well so far.
			My website is about cool stuff. A little bit of me is sprinkled in, but overall it's supposed to be about things that r cool.
			My "Thesis", I guess, is that the main point of the site is to display, discuss, and provide info on, Cool Stuff.
