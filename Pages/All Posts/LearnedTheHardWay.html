		<h1><u>Stuff I've learned the hard way</u></h1>

		<p>
			Hiya,<br>
			So every now and then I figure a little something out and I write it out on my whiteboard.
			During that I usually end up going through repeats, because I'm a bit dense and it takes me a while to 
			learn basic stuff. So here's a list of basic stuff I've learned over the years.<br>
			<br>
			- Get out of your own head, your feelings don't have to be your reality.<br>
			- Unhealthy obsession is the a step on the path to spiraling. Healthy 
			obsession however, is good, be obsessed with doing that which makes you good,
			with doing that you refused to do yesterday, and struggle to do today. Do that
			which scares you, and do it well.<br>
			- Look around, get out of your thoughts for a little, and see
			the world around you. You will realize what you need to do. <br>
			- You do not have to be your anxieties, your worries, your complaints. <br>
			- Take a second, breathe, look around, realize what needs to be done,
			and take it upon yourself to do it.<br>
