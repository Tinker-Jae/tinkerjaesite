		<h1><u>Ambition and Patience.</u></h1>
		
		<p>I think I had a small epiphany on projects, application, and technique.<br>
		I was just doing some small skills practice on knots and rope tying. I realized after taking a break that I could do much cooler and more advanced stuff, and post it as a project to boot. I wonder why I don&#39;t do that with all my projects, I thought to myself. Then it hit me, like a fastball to the jaw. I have the skills and &quot;intelligence&quot; to be able to do so many great things, but like many things in life are, it&#39;s about commitment. I feel if I was just 10% more patient, 10% more committed, 10% more willing to let myself work, wait, see, and follow through, I&#39;d have 10 times the projects done as I do now. I realize now it&#39;s more about being willing to commit and follow through with the boring stuff projects and content creation require. The documentation, the camera work, editing, writing, and god just taking pictures is a pain on it&#39;s own. But that&#39;s what projects are, they&#39;re both the fun exploration of your skills, and the learning of how to temper your soul and gentle yourself. It&#39;s both the creativity, and the practicality. That was a very cool thought. It makes me motivated to do more projects, and I think that, knowing now that it&#39;s more about the boring stuff, it makes me more prepared to tackle different kinds of projects. </p>
		<p>Ambition and patience, two opposite halves of a synchronized whole.<br>
		Thanks for reading.</p>
