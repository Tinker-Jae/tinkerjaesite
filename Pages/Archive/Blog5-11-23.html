		<p>
			I've been working on the v1.05 update and I'm finally done. I had a bunch of issues with updating posts and stuff so 
			I decided to make an update to the site that allows me to more easily add and categorize posts. It was a LOT of work,
			alongside the little redesign of the site, the homepage, and updating a lot of redundant stuff to Javascript.<br>
			<br>
			Anyways, I'm done with school for the semester and am ready for a productive summer! I'm hoping to do a lot more blogging, projects, music, and making a whole
			bunch of money for next semester. Very excited to get back to working and making stuff. I didn't do as well as I had hoped academically, but I have a good feeling
			about next semester and this summer.<br>
			<br>
			 That's all for now, I gotta go run some errands. Thanks for reading!
