		<h1><u>11k Views!!!</u></h1>

		<p>
			Wow! <br>
			I am flabbergasted! Dude I never expected the site to receive this many views! <br>
			<br>
			I remember a while back, I posted something about hitting 10k views. I think I deleted it
			as well as a bunch of other posts when I did <a href="/Pages/Archive/v1.05Changelog.html">v1.05</a> for the site. 
			And (I'm aware this is grammatically incorrect) I didn't share this yet but I'm definitely sure that views has to do 
			with how often I update the site/how many times I update the site. For example, this:
		</p>

		<div class="PostImageBlock">
			<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/qnzj8k.png" class="Border">
			A graph of views for the site in relation to time.<br>
			(ignore the taller, lighter colored line, that's "hits"
			and it doesn't matter for site view count rly.)
		</div>

		<p>
			I don't want to post 15 different images so here's the date alone from the graph.<br>
			May 6: 13 Views<br>
			May 7: 6 Views<br>
			May 8: 15 Views<br>
			May 9: 34 Views<br>
			May 10: 670 Views<br>
			May 11: 718 Views<br>
			May 12: 67 Views<br>
			<br>
			As you can see, there happens to be a bit of an uptick on May 10th and 11th. These happen to be the days 
			I updated the site the most for <a href="/Pages/Archive/v1.05Changelog.html">v1.05</a> This trend has been
			mostly consistent as well, seeing the same type of relationship happpen every time I update the site a whole bunch.
		</p>

		<p>
			What I think is happening is that everytime I update the site I get people finding me via the last updated filter via
			neocities, but I can't be sure. For those of you that view this post and read this, 1. Thank you, 2. Would you mind
			giving me some feedback? You can either email me @ <a href="mailto:tinkerjaesite@proton.me">tinkerjaesite@proton.me</a> 
			or you can leave a note on my <a href="http://users.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&i=g19-00633-9f">guestbook</a>.
