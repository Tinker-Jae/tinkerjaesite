				I uh, I'm not happy abt this.  
			   Happy that I'm talking about it.
			   It's Nov 27th, 2022.
			   I feel like I'm kind of, stuck, I don't know. 
			   I just feel emotionally pent up and I don't know how I'm supposed to get rid of this. 
			   I want to scream and that's good right? A sign I"m alive, but also it sucks because I feel like crying. 
			   I just, I keep feeling shit about going to college but I've not really got any other choice.  
			   to do what I want. What's the path. 
			   I want to be, fulfilled. robots r cool and so r mechs but how do I use those to help people or make people laugh or help myself??? <br>
			   I've no idea. 
			   Life's been going alright recently other than work but I just, I still feel shitty yk.
			   I still feel like I'm going to cry any moment. I want peace. 
			   I think that, that dude on the internet talking about action vs indentity.
			   Who you are by blood and birth vs who you become, what you do by choice, What you pursue, etc.
			   idk 
			   just
			   I wanna be able to cry
			   I wanna be able to puruse my interests
			   I want to be real and genuine.
			   enough from me, I'm going to bed, bye bye!
