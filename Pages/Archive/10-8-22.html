			Little Journal for the day. <br>
			Hi!! This is my first post. Well, let me welcome you to my website I guess. <br>
			Yesterday I went to see Panic at The Disco, live, in concert with my bf!
			It was an awesome show, while not what I expected and also not what I was used to, it was pretty great!<br>
			Yesterday I also finished the main outline for my site! There's still kinks to be worked out but the main structure and stuff is done!
			I can now write my fruity little blog posts and write my posts about other things! Finally! I've been dreaming about this site for,
			I don't even know, for months at least. <br>
			Ah yes, the issue. So, alot of my blog posts are most likely gonna contain some sort of issue I'm dealing with at the time, so heads up.<br>
			The current issue I'm dealing with (rather was dealing with) is, what do I do in regards to my hobbies n stuff.
			Basically been putting a whole bunch of pressure on myself to be a certain way instead of just enjoying my projects and stuff.<br>
			Anyways, gotta wrap this up cuz I'm going to go hangout with a friendo and go see a concert again. <br> 
			Per audacia ad astra! Love y'all and please, come back soon!
