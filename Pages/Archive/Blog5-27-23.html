			I gotta add a title to this one lol.<br>
			soooooooooooooo<br>
			<br>
			ya so I'm going through, a lot emotionally rn.
			Tbh I have no idea what's up so, idk.
			Went to my boyf's graduation and 
			idk
			I saw a bunch of people, all bright eyed and stuff.
			and it kind of made me realize that I can like do better
			and that I've wasted part of my life being very cynical and mean, for no good reason.

			So while we're here I guess I'll explain what exactly I mean.
			For the past few months I've been working at a retail store, not enjoying it all that much to be real with you.
			I hate the environment
			I don't mind the work but the people are so, just fucking annoying to be honest.
