			Honestly bro, I did not want to transcribe all of this, here's some cliff notes. <br>
			If you wanna go make something, go for specifics, I want to teach so I look at general stuff, but specifics and practice can help alot before generalizing advice.
			Commit some time and money to your projects, nothing gets done without those.
			Turn your brain off worry mode, just go do the thing and try to complete it and have fun while doing it.
			This goes for me too, just do the stuff, have fun, get inspired, write about it.
			Lastly, rememeber this. It's not that deep, try to have fun with it, enjoy it.
			Okay I'm not writing anything else, thanks for reading/listening. BAI!!!!!
